## Preview

grand-node-java-client is a JVM client for GrandNode2 API and aims to provide a high level of abstraction for using its
APIs.

This project is powered by [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
and [Project Lombok](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok)
therefore it's easy to use if you are already familiar with them, but it's also limited by their constraints. However,
since `Retrofit` is a highly customizable library and this project doesn't prevent you from customizing it, you can form
a custom client by changing various properties of the Retrofit instance(like `OkHttpClient`, `baseUrl`, etc.).

This library uses a custom `CallAdapter` for its API calls (`CallX`) which is an extended version of Retrofit's `Call`
with some additional methods so this is an aspect of the library that is not customizable.

## Compatibility

**JVM11+**

## Usage

[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/com.github.TradersTeam/grand-node-java-client/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.TradersTeam/grand-node-java-client)

### Quick Guide

1. Create a client instance from `GrandNodeClient` class and customize it if you want with the help of `builder` method.
2. Create a service instance related to the API you want to use by calling `create` method on the client.
3. Call the service's methods(different type of API calls defined for each API service).
4. Handle the response using various callbacks that are provided by `Retrofit` and other custom callbacks(`CallX`).
